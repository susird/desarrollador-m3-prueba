## About this project
⚛️ This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

🎨 The project uses CSS3 for the styling.

🗄 The data was served using My JSON server from my own repository's db.json file.

⚓️ The project uses React Hooks to manage the state in the App.

## What's Included

following features:

## Wall of Shame

Several things I would've liked to do but I didn't have enough time. 

- Add all the logic to the size and price filters.
- Refactor Filters component to create the checkbox dinamically.
- Improve the styles for a more user-friendly view.
- Styling the Accordion component in a better way.
- Improve the logic of the item counter to avoid prop drilling.
